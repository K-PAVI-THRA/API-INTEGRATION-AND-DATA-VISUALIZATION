# DESCRIPTION API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION

To complete the task of API integration and data visualization using Python, I'll guide you through the steps necessary to fetch data from a public API (like OpenWeatherMap), process it, and then create a visualization using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

# Step 1: Fetching Data from an API
We will use OpenWeatherMap API as an example. You can access weather data, which includes information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Required libraries:

requests: To send requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
matplotlib: To create the visualizations.
seaborn: For enhanced visualization 
pandas: For data manipulation 

# Step 2: Create a Visualization Dashboard
You can extend this script to show multiple cities or visualize more data points, such as pressure, wind speed, and weather descriptions. You could even include a more sophisticated dashboard using Dash or Streamlit for an interactive experience.

Hereâ€™s an idea for a dashboard:

Show temperature, humidity, and wind speed in a table format.
Use multiple plots for different weather parameters.
Additional Libraries for Dashboard:
If you wish to build an interactive dashboard, you can use frameworks like:

Dash: Ideal for creating web applications.
Streamlit: Very easy for rapid development of data applications.

# Step 3: Deliverables
Python Script: The Python code that fetches data and creates visualizations (like the one shown above).
Visualization Dashboard: Optionally, you can create a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash, making the visualizations interactive.
Output: The visualizations (such as bar charts for temperature and humidity) and any additional information like wind speed.
